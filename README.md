# AI Techniques for Disaster Response Optimization

## **Overview**
This project applies multiple **Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques** to optimize disaster response operations. It simulates **multi-agent coordination, resource allocation, and decision-making under uncertainty** in disaster scenarios such as **earthquakes, fires, and road blockages**.

## **Key AI Techniques Used**
The project integrates several AI approaches to improve emergency response strategies:

### **1. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**
- Simulates emergency vehicles navigating through disaster-affected areas.
- Uses **pheromone-based reinforcement learning** to identify optimal routes.

### **2. Genetic Algorithms (GA)**
- Evolves efficient travel paths over multiple generations.
- Uses selection, crossover, and mutation to improve search strategies.

### **3. Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**
- Models decision-making for allocating rescue teams efficiently.
- Uses a **game tree search** to optimize resource deployment.

### **4. Game Theory (Nash Equilibrium)**
- Determines optimal strategies for coordinating multiple response units.
- Models interactions between rescue teams to prevent resource conflicts.

### **5. Bayesian Networks**
- Models uncertain disaster conditions (e.g., fire spread, road blockages).
- Uses **probabilistic reasoning** to improve situational awareness.

## **Project Goals**
- Develop AI-powered decision-making tools for disaster response.  
- Simulate **multi-agent coordination** in a crisis scenario.  
- Improve **route optimization** for emergency vehicles.  
- Use **AI models** to make strategic rescue decisions under uncertainty.  

By combining these AI techniques, this project **mimics real-world disaster response operations**, making it an excellent foundation for practical AI applications in **emergency management, logistics, and smart city planning**.
